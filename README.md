# Coffee Chat

Coffee Chat is a pioneering AI agent system that can autonomously make purchases on third-party e-commerce sites. Unlike traditional integrations that require partner APIs, this agent can hold user funds and execute purchases through web automation - starting with a focused use case of coffee beans to validate the concept.

## Overview

Coffee Chat demonstrates a novel approach to AI-powered shopping:

1. **Autonomous Shopping**: The AI agent doesn't just recommend - it can hold funds and complete purchases through web automation without requiring direct API integration
2. **Secure Fund Management**: Uses Stripe's platform to securely hold user funds and issue virtual cards for purchases
3. **Web Automation**: Leverages Browserbase to execute the complete purchase flow on e-commerce sites

### How It Works

1. **Conversation & Discovery**
   - AI-powered chat to understand user preferences
   - Expert knowledge base for informed recommendations
   - Dynamic filtering to find the perfect match

2. **Payment & Fund Holding**
   - Secure fund collection via Stripe Checkout
   - Funds held in escrow until purchase confirmation
   - Automated refund system if execution fails

3. **Purchase Execution**
   The magic happens through a sophisticated automation flow:
   - Stripe creates a virtual card for the purchase
   - Browserbase executes the complete checkout process
   - Real-time status updates throughout the process
   - Automatic error recovery and refund processing

### Safety First

The system is built with multiple layers of protection:

- Stripe handles all financial transactions and fund holding
- Virtual cards provide an extra layer of security
- Automated refund processing on any failure
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Real-time transaction monitoring

### Why This Matters

This project demonstrates a new paradigm for AI shopping agents:

1. **Novel Approach**: Instead of requiring partner integrations or APIs, this agent can potentially work with any e-commerce site through web automation

2. **Complete Process**:
   - Holds user funds securely
   - Creates virtual payment methods
   - Executes full purchase flows
   - Handles shipping and delivery details

3. **Scalable Foundation**:
   - Built on Vercel's infrastructure
   - Uses Stripe's secure payment platform
   - Powered by Browserbase's reliable automation

While currently focused on a single e-commerce use case, this represents the first step toward truly autonomous shopping agents - ones that could eventually navigate and purchase from any e-commerce site, just like a human would.
