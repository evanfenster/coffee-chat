      <p>
        Welcome to Barista Agent (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;), an AI-driven platform developed by Evan Fenster (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) that helps you find your next favorite coffee bean and facilitates the purchase process. By creating an account and using our Service, you (&ldquo;User&rdquo; or &ldquo;you&rdquo;) agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;). These Terms also serve as our Privacy Policy.
      </p>

        By accessing or using Barista Agent, you agree to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not create an account or use our Service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility and Account Creation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Eligibility:</strong> You must be at least 18 years of age and capable of entering into a binding agreement to use our Service.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Service Description</h2>
      <p>
        Barista Agent is an AI chatbot that assists users in identifying coffee beans of interest. When you select &ldquo;Buy Now,&rdquo; you will complete a payment through Stripe. Upon payment, our system uses the provided card details (processed securely by Stripe) and the shipping information you supply to complete a purchase on your behalf from a designated website. We do not store any card information; only shipping details are retained for the purpose of fulfilling your order.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Agency Relationship and Purchase Process</h2>
      <p>
        When you use our Service to place an order for coffee beans or related products, you authorize the purchase of those goods from the retailers we select on your behalf. You acknowledge and agree that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Barista Agent is acting as your agent in the ordering, purchasing, and arranging delivery of goods purchased by you;</li>
        <li>The retailer—not Barista Agent—is the seller of the goods to you;</li>
        <li>Title to any goods passes to you when they are purchased from the applicable retailer&apos;s store or website;</li>
        <li>Barista Agent will obtain an authorization for your payment method on file with Stripe to cover the cost of the goods purchased from the retailer on your behalf, plus any applicable fees, taxes, and/or shipping costs;</li>
        <li>Your payment method will be charged for the goods purchased by Barista Agent on your behalf and any applicable fees, taxes, and/or shipping costs.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Customer Service and Returns:</h3>
      <p>
        As your purchasing agent, Barista Agent will make reasonable efforts to assist with customer service issues, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Communicating with retailers regarding order status, shipping delays, or product quality issues;</li>
        <li>Facilitating returns or exchanges according to the retailer&apos;s policies;</li>
        <li>Providing order tracking information when available.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        However, you understand that as we are purchasing products on your behalf from third-party retailers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All purchases are subject to the retailer&apos;s terms, conditions, and return policies;</li>
        <li>We cannot guarantee acceptance of returns or exchanges beyond what the retailer&apos;s policies allow;</li>
        <li>In the event of product defects or shipping damage, we will work as your agent to seek appropriate remedies from the retailer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Payment and Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Payments are processed by Stripe, a third-party payment provider. By using our Service, you agree to be bound by Stripe&rsquo;s terms and privacy policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Transaction Process:</strong> Once you complete the Stripe checkout, we immediately initiate a purchase via an automated agent. If the transaction fails, an instant refund is triggered through Stripe (typically within 2 minutes; however, processing times may vary based on Stripe&rsquo;s policies).
