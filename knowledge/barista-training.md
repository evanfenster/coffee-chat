# Coffee Growing Regions

There are three primary coffee-growing regions, each distinct in its landscape, its climate and the flavor profile it gives to the coffees grown and processed there.Coffee buyers travel across the global coffee belt to buy the very best green coffee each region has to offer. They carefully select coffees with flavor characteristics that define these regions.

## Latin America
* Refers to coffee-growing regions of Mexico and countries in Central and South America
* Crisp acidity with flavors of nuts, cocoa and soft spice
* Pike Place® Roast is a Latin America blend

## Multi-Region Blends
* Blends rely on buying the world's best coffees and combining them to achieve an interesting mix of flavors and aromas
* Espresso Roast is a multi-region blend

## Asia/Pacific
* This vast region has a wide range of climates, topographies and coffee qualities
* Full-bodied and syrupy smooth with herbal, earthy flavors
* Provides body and complexity for many signature blends like Caffè Verona®

## Africa
* Home of some of the most exotic coffee flavors
* Lush and juicy, with flavors of floral and citrus from berry and spice
* Kenya is an African coffee

# Growing, Harvesting and Processing Coffee

## Growing Coffee
* The average coffee tree produces enough cherries each season to yield roughly 1 pound of roasted coffee
* Roughly 5 pounds of coffee cherries are required to produce 1 pound of green coffee

There are two commercially significant coffee species: Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta. Purchases only the finest, high-altitude arabica coffees available. These high-quality arabica coffees flourish at altitudes of 3,000 feet and above. The flavor of these beans develops fully through the roast.

## Harvesting Coffee
During the harvest season, coffee trees become full with bright red coffee cherries. Ripe cherries are slightly larger than a blueberry. The green (or unroasted) coffee bean is the pit, or seed, of the coffee cherry.

There are five layers that surround the coffee bean:
* The outermost layer, the skin of the coffee cherry, is thick with a slightly bitter flavor
* The next layer, the fruit, is sweet. The texture of this layer is similar to that of a grape
* The next layer is the mucilage - a thin, slippery, honey-like layer that covers the parchment layer
* The parchment serves as a protective layer for the coffee bean
* Removing the parchment reveals two bluish-green coffee beans that are coated with a very thin layer called the silverskin

While most coffee cherries contain two beans, 5 to 10 percent of all cherries contain only one bean. This is called a peaberry—a round-shaped bean that forms when one of the two flat-sided beans in the coffee cherry fails to grow.

## Processing
Processing is the term used to describe how the beans (seeds) are removed from the coffee cherry. Processing plays a part in overall flavor, acidity and body.

1. **Washed Process**: Pulp is mechanically removed, leaving a sticky layer called mucilage on the bean. Beans are washed and then held in a concrete fermentation tank for 18–36 hours to develop flavor, acidity and body. One final washing, and the beans are dried, parchment is removed and the green beans are sorted and graded.

2. **Semi-Washed Process**: Coffee pulp is removed using small hand-pulping machines, and then the coffee is washed and laid out to dry in the sun. After partial drying, parchment is removed and the coffee is laid out again for final drying, followed by sorting and grading.

3. **Natural Process**: Coffee cherries are allowed to dry completely on the bean, letting the bean develop flavors before the skin and parchment are removed, followed by sorting and grading.

# Roasting Coffee

The roast is not a time, temperature or color—it's a philosophy. We organize our coffees in three roast profiles:
* Blonde Roast
* Medium Roast 
* Dark Roast

Research tells us that customers use roast to indicate flavor, so these profiles help them quickly find coffees. Our core blends for We Proudly Serve programs are Veranda Blend®, Pike Place® Roast and Caffè Verona®.

## FlavorLock™ Packaging
FlavorLock™ packaging helps ensure the freshness of coffee. The one-way valve in this packaging allows coffee to "de-gas" while limiting the coffee's exposure to oxygen, light and moisture.

## Coffee Buying
We've always believed that businesses can and should make a positive impact on the communities they serve. So we set goals in the areas of our business where we can have the greatest impact.

Ethical sourcing commitment to offering the highest quality ethically purchased and responsibly produced coffee, tea, cocoa and manufactured goods, helps to create a better future for farmers and suppliers.

# Brewing and Tasting Coffee

How you grind, brew and store coffee is as important as the coffee you choose.

## Four Fundamentals of Brewing

### Proportion
The ratio of coffee to water. Proportion allows the proper extraction of the coffee's full flavors—creating a rich, aromatic cup. Using too little coffee makes a bitter cup. Using too much coffee creates an under-extracted cup that has off flavors.

Always follow proper measurement for specific equipment being used.

### Grind
The grind determines how long the coffee/water are in contact and how much flavor is extracted from the coffee. A proper grind should be determined by the brew method and ensures that only the coffee's best flavors end up in the cup.

Proper grind for your brewing method delivers only the coffee's best flavors.

### Water
Coffee is 98% water, and good-tasting water is essential to a good cup. Full extraction of the coffee's flavor happens between 195° and 205°F. Always brew using a water filter.

### Freshness
Think of coffee as fresh produce and protect it from oxygen, light, heat and moisture. Never store coffee in a refrigerator or freezer for daily use as moisture condenses on the coffee and can damage it.
* Coffee should not be re-heated
* Portion pack coffee should be used immediately after opening

## Brewing Steps
1. Make sure server is clean prior to brewing
2. Pre-heat server prior to brewing
3. Place filter in brew basket
4. Pour the entire portion pack into the brew basket; shake to level
5. Slide the brew basket into the rails until it stops
6. The green ready light must be on to start the brew cycle
7. Make sure the pre-heated empty server is under the brew basket
8. Push the start switch
9. Do not remove the server until the coffee has stopped dripping
10. Close the lid on the server in order to retain heat
11. Follow brewed coffee hold-time standards:
    * 2 hours – airpot/shuttles and thermal servers
    * 1 hour – heated server
    * 20 minutes – glass pot and coffee press

## Enemies of Coffee Flavor
* Air: Coffee should not be exposed to air before you are ready to brew
* Light: Prolonged exposure to light can alter the taste of the coffee
* Heat: Prolonged exposure to heat can dry out the coffee
* Moisture: Moisture before brewing will alter the taste of the coffee
* Strong Aromas: Exposure to strong aromas will alter the taste

## Coffee Freshness
"BEST BEFORE" date is normally located on the back seam of most 2.5, 5, 9 and 16 oz. portion pack coffee. This date indicates the expiration date of the coffee and should not be brewed past this date.

Example of "BEST BEFORE" date:
* PIKE PLACE - Coffee blend name
* CRP079045D0547 05/11/13 – Lot Code & BEST BEFORE date

## Coffee Tasting

### Activity #1: Tasting Coffee
Understanding coffee is key in creating enthusiastically satisfied customers. When exploring the Roast Spectrum, Blonde, Medium and Dark roasts are the best way to experience the range of coffees.

### Coffee Tasting Characteristics
Compare and contrast coffees by identifying these four tasting characteristics:

* **Aroma**: The way coffee smells—could be earthy, spicy, floral, nutty or other. These aromas are directly related to the coffee's flavor.
* **Acidity**: This is a tangy quality or tartness, not the pH level of the coffee. You can feel acidity on the sides and tip of your tongue, similar to when you taste citrus fruit and drinks. Coffees with high acidity are normally described as bright, tangy and crisp. Coffees with low acidity feel smooth and linger on your tongue.
* **Body**: The weight of the coffee on your tongue. Does it feel light or full in your mouth? It's like comparing whole milk to non-fat milk.
* **Flavor**: The way coffee tastes. This characteristic is registered in different parts of the mouth. Citrus, cocoa and berries are just a few flavors you might sense.

### Tasting Steps
Follow these four steps every time you taste to appreciate the characteristics of the coffee:

1. **Smell**: Always smell the coffee before you taste it. Your nose can detect thousands of smells. Cup your hand over the cup, hold the cup close to your nose and inhale.
2. **Slurp**: When tasting coffee it's important to slurp it. Slurping sprays coffee across your entire palate and lets subtle flavors and aromas reach your nose.
3. **Locate**: Think about where you are experiencing flavors on your tongue. Is it on the tip and sides? What's the mouthfeel and weight of the coffee on your tongue?
4. **Describe**: Now that you've smelled and tasted the coffee, think about how you would describe the experience. Describe the aroma, acidity, body and flavor.

## Preparing Iced Coffee

### Quality Tips
* Do not brew directly into an airpot or other insulated dispenser. Coffee will not cool to proper temperature
* Allow at least 10 minutes for ice to fully melt into hot concentrate before serving
* Serve over ice at room temperature or from cooler (refrigerated) to avoid further dilution
* Shelf life of brewed iced coffee:
    * 12 hours at room temperature
    * 12 hours refrigerated

Follow brewing tips as outlined in the Iced Coffee Product Card and prepare accordingly based on type of equipment in your operation.

### Serving Iced Coffee
The standard recipe for serving iced coffee includes the beverage sweetened with Fontana® Classic syrup and milk. Recipes vary based on size and optional syrups can be substituted with flavors like vanilla, hazelnut or caramel.
