## Module 1: What is Coffee?

### Objective
Explain coffee as a natural plant and where it grows so students can build their knowledge on this foundation.

### Where is Coffee Grown?
Coffee is grown typically between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn where conditions are ideal for the species. There are two main branches of the coffee varietal, Robust and Arabica. Robusta is less flavoursome, high yielding with high pest tolerance. Hence, it is great for cheaper, low-quality instant coffees. Arabica makes up the majority of the coffee grown in the world and is what holds the exciting flavours and aromas that you think of when you dream of coffee.

### The Coffee Tree and Cherry
The coffee tree and its cherries can be a number of colours depending on the varietal. Mainly they are bright red, but sometimes they can be yellow. There a number of layers in the coffee cherry, before you get to the actual coffee bean that we know.

## Module 2: Tools of the Trade

### Objective
Show in a real setting what tools Baristas use on a daily basis which will give them the confidence to approach and utilize these tools during real service.

### Grinders

#### Grinder Function
To chop the coffee beans as evenly as possible at the exact particle size as quickly as possible.

#### Components
- The Hopper – where the whole beans sit
- The Bean Gate – to stop the flow of beans into the blades
- Grinder Blades
- Grind Adjustment Wheel – to move the blades closer or further away
- Coffee Tunnel – where the ground beans travel after the blades
- Dosing Chamber – where the ground coffee falls to after the tunnel
- Manual Doser – the mechanism that portions out ground coffee
- Portafilter Stand – where you put your group handle to catch the grounds

#### Grind Adjustment
When adjusting the grind, you are moving the blades closer or farther from each other.

The Tunnel: After the beans are ground, they enter a tunnel before dropping into the dosing chamber. When making a grind adjustment, it's important to realize there are about 3 shots of coffee in the tunnel from the previous grind change. This means that if you make a grind adjustment, it will take 3 more shots of coffee to notice that change. We purge our coffee if we need to make a large adjustment.

### Types of Grinders

#### Manual Grinder
The manual chamber uses a doser that portions out small amounts of ground coffee. Note it is not accurate for measuring - always weigh your doses.

Important: Never use the pre-grind function. Coffee loses its aroma within seconds of being ground. Always grind to order.

#### Automatic Grinder
Similar to the manual but automated. When you press a button, it grinds for a set amount of time directly into your portafilter. Note that even the best grinders can produce inconsistent weights, so it's important to weigh your shots periodically.

### Weighing Coffee
1. Take a spare takeaway coffee cup on your scales
2. Place dose in the scales
3. Adjust the dose to get desired weight (e.g. 21g)
4. Distribute back in the portafilter, grooming again

### Tamping Coffee
Use a handheld tamper that is quite heavy and feels comfortable. Correct tamping technique is important for even extraction and ergonomics.

Technique:
1. Grasp the tamper like a TV remote control
2. Use your body weight and shoulder rather than your wrist
3. Tamp lightly first to flatten the bed
4. Apply a second tamp with body weight for 1 second
5. Remove excess grounds

### Coffee Machine

#### Setup
- Keep machine on unless closing for over 3 days
- Run morning seasoning shots through each group head
- Purge steam wand
- Arrange equipment (cleaning cloths, etc.)

#### Maintenance
- Clean group heads every 10-20 shots using blank head
- Keep steam wand unblocked and clean after every use
- Wipe portafilter and basket regularly

#### Closing Procedures
Group Heads:
1. Flush with blank head (5 seconds in, 5 seconds out)
2. Repeat with coffee cleaner
3. Run each head 30 seconds to flush chemical

Steam Wand:
1. Soak tip in cleaner solution for one minute
2. Clean thoroughly with scourer
3. Check holes and steam pressure

## Module 3: The Coffee Process and Roasting

## Coffee Processing
Once coffee berries are picked, they need preparation for roasting. The processing method significantly impacts flavor and body.

### Washed Process
1. Berries pulped in wet mill
2. Beans washed up to 12 times
3. Green beans dried (mechanical or natural)
Result: Clean tasting coffee

### Natural Process
1. Berries laid on drying beds
2. Constantly turned for even drying
3. Dried fruit pulped in dry mill
Note: Raised beds improve airflow and reduce fermentation risks

### Honey Process
1. Berries sorted by ripeness
2. Pulp removed but mucilage retained
3. Different levels: Yellow, Orange, Red, Black Honey
Result: Enhanced sweetness and body

## Coffee Roasting

### Roasting Methods
1. Fluid Bed Roaster (Air Roaster)
   - Uses hot air through vertical tube
   - Beans suspended in air

2. Drum Roaster
   - Traditional method
   - Metal drum over gas flame
   - Variables: flame size, airflow, drum speed

## Module 4: Coffee Types

## Single Origin vs Blends

### Single Origin
- Traceable to one origin/country
- Shows distinct regional characteristics
- Influenced by terroir (soil, climate, etc.)
- Best for black coffee and filter methods

### Blends
- Mix of different origins
- Designed for specific purposes
- Often optimized for milk-based drinks
- Can create consistent flavor profiles

## Decaf - Swiss Water Process
- Chemical-free decaffeination
- Uses Green Coffee Extract (GCE)
- Preserves coffee's essential flavors
- Only removes caffeine molecules

## Module 5: Working with Coffee

## Fresh Coffee Storage
- Don't store in freezer or fridge
- Use zip lock bags with one-way valves
- Best used 2-14 days after roast
- Peak flavor around 6 days post-roast

## Extraction Basics
- Resistance vs. force principle
- Aim for even water distribution
- Target 18-22% extraction yield
- Balance of water, oils, and solids

## Common Problems

### Channeling
- Caused by uneven distribution
- Results in inconsistent extraction
- Fix with level tamping and even distribution

### Grind Size & Dose
- Affects resistance to water flow
- Finer grind = more resistance
- Coarser grind = less resistance
- Always weigh doses for consistency

### Over/Under Extraction
Over extraction:
- Too much water contact
- Too fine grind
- Results in bitter taste

Under extraction:
- Too little water contact
- Too coarse grind
- Results in sour taste
